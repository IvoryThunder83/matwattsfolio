 DEFINE AND DESCRIBES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF THE INTERNET SUCH AS: DOMAINS, WEB SERVERS, DNS AND WEB BROWSERS.

         Domains - Or domain names are what people type in to access a site, for eg. BigCats.com, without it, we'd have to type in an IP address, which is difficult to remember. The domain name indicates to the web browser the location (web server) it needs to retrieve pages/s, which it then interprets and renders for the user to view. 

         Web Servers - A physical machine that hosts the files and the databases that your website is made from and sends  them out to people across the internet when they visit your site from thier machine. 

         DNS - Domain Name System (Server), is the term used to describe a system that assigns user-friendly domain names to unique IP addresses. 
        
         Web Browsers - Are applications used to access and view websites. Common examples include: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox etc, they retrieve code from a web server, then interpret and display it for a user to view.
